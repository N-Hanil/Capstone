    <h1>Mental Health Day</h1>
    <h2>Celebrated on 10th of October</h2>
   
    <p>World Mental Health Day is an international day for global mental health education, awareness and advocacy against social stigma. It was first celebrated in 1992 at the initiative of the World Federation for Mental Health, a global mental health organization with members and contacts in more than 150 countries. This day, each October, thousands of supporters come to celebrate this annual awareness program to bring attention to mental illness and its major effects on peoples' lives worldwide. In some countries this day is part of an awareness week, such as Mental Health Week in Australia.</p>
    <p> </p>
    <p>The World Health Organisation recognises World Mental Health Day on 10 October every year. This year's theme set by the World Federation for Mental Health is 'mental health for all'.</p>
    <p> </p>
    <p>Each year, we endeavour to get as many cities, businesses, schools, landmarks and people to acknowledge World Mental Health Day and LIGHT UP PURPLE to recognize and promote awareness about mental health on World Mental Health Day on October 10th.</p>
