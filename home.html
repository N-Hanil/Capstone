  <h1>Mental Health</h1>
  <p>Mental health includes our emotional, psychological, and social well-being. It affects how we think, feel, and act. It also helps determine how we handle stress, relate to others, and make choices. Mental health is important at every stage of life, from childhood and adolescence through adulthood</p>
  <p>Each illness has its own symptoms, but common signs of mental illness in adults and adolescents can include the following: Excessive worrying or fear. Feeling excessively sad or low. Confused thinking or problems concentrating and learning.</p>
  <h1>How is it caused?</h1>
  <p>Mental illnesses may be caused by a reaction to environmental stresses, genetic factors, biochemical imbalances, or a combination of these. With proper care and treatment many individuals learn to cope or recover from a mental illness or emotional disorder</p>
